## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later)
- `npm` (usually comes with Node.js)

### Backend Setup

The backend server handles all interactions with the Google Gemini API and requires an API key.

1.  **Navigate to the project root directory.**

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory and add your Google Gemini API key:
    ```
    API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```

4.  **Set up Firebase Admin:**
    - Download your service account key file from your Firebase project settings.
    - Rename it to `firebase-service-account.json` and place it in the project's root directory.

5.  **Start the server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    The server will be running at `http://localhost:3001`.

### Frontend Setup

The frontend is designed to run directly from the `index.html` file using modern browser features like import maps.

1.  **Serve the project folder.**
    You can use a simple static server or a VS Code extension like [Live Server](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

2.  **Open the application.**
    Navigate to the local URL provided by your server (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5500/index.html`). The application should load and connect to the backend server running on port `3001`.

## üìù Change Log

A log of recent changes and improvements to the application.

### `2024-07-27`
- **Feature**: The welcome modal now appears every time for non-logged-in users.
- **Behavior Before**: The welcome modal only appeared on the user's very first visit. After being closed once, it would not show again.
- **Behavior After**: If a user is not logged in, the welcome modal will now be displayed every time they open or refresh the application, encouraging them to sign up or log in.

### `2024-07-26`
- **Feature**: Added `README.md` to the project to provide comprehensive documentation.
- **Behavior Before**: The project lacked a central document explaining its purpose, features, and setup instructions.
- **Behavior After**: A detailed `README.md` is now available, improving project clarity and onboarding for new developers.

### `2024-07-25`
- **Fix**: Resolved an issue where users could not type in the password fields on the Login and Sign Up forms.
- **Behavior Before**: The password input components were defined inside the `AuthPage` component, causing them to re-render on every keystroke and lose focus.
- **Behavior After**: The `PasswordInput` component was moved outside the `AuthPage` component, ensuring its state is preserved correctly and allowing users to enter their credentials without interruption.
